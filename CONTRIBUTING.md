##Contributing

While there is already vision for where this project is going, contributions aren't out of the question! If you have ideas you're welcome to create a feature branch for your idea and submit a pull request, although I can't promise anything at this point about whether or not it will be included. When in doubt, feel free to reach out on twitter @synthona or send an email to synthona@gmail.com! The sorts of contributions I think would be especially helpful would be ideas & contributions from people who know a lot about security, recommendations for refactoring/cleanup for better code legibility, bug fixes, and the like. Even if you see something else, if you are looking through the code and something catches your eye, a potential fix or quick feature add that you think would be a big deal, we'd love to hear from you! Worst case scenario the suggestion doesn't work out, no big deal.

Another key point...

Another excellent way to contribute is to subscribe to the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/creator-home), give feedback on twitter or via email, or to donate to the project on [itch.io](https://yarnpoint.itch.io/yarnpoint)! At the moment the project is a little underfunded and I (me) the founder of the project am unemployed and looking for work...So if you want to pay me just to work on this, that would help a ton! If the Patreon ever became big enough we could even branch out into making more software and maybe start a co-op tech company...

If you're planning on downloading the code and turning it into something else, I'd also love to hear about what you're doing with it and we can maybe link out to your project!!! That about wraps it up, have a nice day!
